# Installation

You will want to install globally on your device 

```
npm i -g cli-task-timers
```

# Usage

The tool is simple to use! Just type in the command `ttimer` in the command line.

You will then be prompted to enter tasks and the time you will devote to doing said task. It will look like this:

Your laptop/computer should then send you notifications on when to begin tasks and a final message when to stop.

# Version

To check which version you have installed, user either ```ttimer --version``` or ```ttimer -v```

# Sidenote / Warning

This command will need its own dedicated terminal to run in for as long as you have set your timers for. You can open new terminals to do your code work!
