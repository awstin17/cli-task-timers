# Installation

You will want to install globally on your device 

```
npm i -g cli-task-timers
```

# Usage

The tool is simple to use! Just type in the command `ttimer` in the command line.

You will then be prompted to enter tasks and the time you will devote to doing said task. It will look like this:

![Task to complete: finish camera component
How long will you "finish camera component" (in minutes): 60
Add another task? (y/n): y
Task to complete: Start new express project
How long will you "Start new express project" (in minutes): 45
Add another task? (y/n): n
Timer Started for "finish camera component"... /](https://github.com/awstin17/task-timer/blob/master/assets/cli-example.PNG "Logo Title Text 1")

Your laptop/computer should then send you notifications on when to begin tasks and a final message when to stop.
